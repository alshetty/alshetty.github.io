  <h1>About us:</h1>
  <p><b>Here at Squashipedia, we believe that squash has become severely overlooked by modern people. Too often has it been overshadowed by its
    much flashier fellow vegetables, to such a degree that we as a society have lost sight of its true value. Does squash taste good?
    No. But its value still remains, waiting to be discovered by an ungrateful world. With this website, we hope to set this amazing
    vegetable on that very path, and give squash the spotlight it deserves, one species at a time.</b></p>

  <h1>General Information:</h1>
   <p><b>Known to the scientific community as <i>Cucurbita</i>, the squash is a genus of herbaceous, or non-woody, vines. 
     These gourds are grown worldwide for both their fruit and their seeds. Most species’ vines grow several meters in length and
     produce yellow and orange flowers before bearing fruit. While all squashes are rich in nutrients, most notably vitamin A and
     vitamin C, the vegetables tend to be split up into two categories: winter squash and summer squash.</b><p>
     <p><b>There are a few key differences between these two varieties. The full grown fruits of winter squash can be stored for months. 
       Their seeds are fully matured and their skin has fully hardened into a tough rind. Winter squash is generally
       cooked before being eaten, but the rind is usually discarded. Common examples of winter squash include pumpkins, butternut
       squash, and acorn squash. On the other hand, summer squash is harvested when still
       immature and the rind is still tender and edible. Their vines don’t ramble as much as winter squashes, and are instead more bushy
       in nature. Some common summer squashes are zucchini, patty pan squashes, and straightneck squash. As the name suggests, their 
       storage life is much shorter than that of the winter squash. Pictured below: Winter squash(left), Summer squash(right).</b></p>

  <h1>History of the Squash:</h1>
   <p><b>Squash is native to the Americas. Ancient squash were present in the Americas long before any humans arrived, likely 
     originating in Southern Mexico before spreading both down into South America, and northward into what is now the Southwestern 
     U.S. The plant was a major facet of the cultures of almost every group of native people from the Southernmost part of South 
     America all the way up to the lower regions of present-day Canada. However, modern day squash in not found in the wild, and 
     studies even show that there were at least six separate domestication events of the plant that led to the distancing of domestic
     species from their wild ancestors.</b></p>
   <p><b>Squash was first domesticated at least 8,000 years ago, predating the cultivation of maize and beans by about 4,000 years.
     However, as these newer foods became more integrated into native agriculture, squash, beans, and corn became the fundamental foods
     of what we now call the Three Sisters. This agricultural system of companion planting was revolutionary for native tribes, 
     with each crop’s growth benefiting from the other two growing nearby. Eventually, in the 16th century, European conquistadors
     exploring the Americas came upon squash themselves, and ended up bringing it back with them. Thus began the squash’s journey
     through the world. Pictured below: Native American gourd bowl(left), the Three Sisters(right).</b></p>

  <h1>Squash in the Modern world:</h1>
   <p><b>Today, squashes have become a part of many different cultures. As a vegetable, squashes are mainly used for culinary
     purposes. In the U.S. some dishes that include squash are: pie, biscuits, bread, cheesecake, desserts, donuts, granola, ice cream, 
     lasagna dishes, pancakes, pudding, pumpkin butter,salads, soups, and stuffing. However, squash is produced worldwide, and is 
     used in cuisine throughout Europe, and even as far as India, Africa, and Japan. Squash, while not the most obviously popular
     food, is still farmed commercially in massive amounts with the more well known varieties, like zucchini and butternut squash 
     available at every grocery store. Squash has even grown to be a part of holidays like Thanksgiving. Pumpkins are a staple part
     of Halloween, but pumpkin festivals are held annually in places as faroff as Argentina, Portugal, and Germany.
