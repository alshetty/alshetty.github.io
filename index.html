  <h1>About us:</h1>
  <p><b>Here at Squashipedia, we believe that squash has become severely overlooked by modern people. Too often has it been overshadowed by its
    much flashier fellow vegetables, to such a degree that we as a society have lost sight of its true value. Does squash taste good?
    No. But its value still remains, waiting to be discovered by an ungrateful world. With this website, we hope to set this amazing
    vegetable on that very path, and give squash the spotlight it deserves, one species at a time.</b></p>
