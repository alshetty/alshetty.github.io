  <h1>About us:</h1>
  <p><b>Here at Squashipedia, we believe that squash has become severely overlooked by modern people. Too often has it been overshadowed by its
    much flashier fellow vegetables, to such a degree that we as a society have lost sight of its true value. Does squash taste good?
    No. But its value still remains, waiting to be discovered by an ungrateful world. With this website, we hope to set this amazing
    vegetable on that very path, and give squash the spotlight it deserves, one species at a time.</b></p>

  <h1>General Information:</h1>
   <p><b>Known to the scientific community as <i>Cucurbita</i>, the squash is a genus of herbaceous, or non-woody, vines. 
     These gourds are grown worldwide for both their fruit and their seeds. Most species’ vines grow several meters in length and
     produce yellow and orange flowers before bearing fruit. While all squashes are rich in nutrients, most notably vitamin A and
     vitamin C, the vegetables tend to be split up into two categories: winter squash and summer squash.</b><p>
     <p><b>There are a few key differences between these two varieties. The full grown fruits of winter squash can be stored for months. 
       Their seeds are fully matured and their skin has fully hardened into a tough rind. Winter squash is generally
       cooked before being eaten, but the rind is usually discarded. Common examples of winter squash include pumpkins, butternut
       squash, and acorn squash. On the other hand, summer squash is harvested when still
       immature and the rind is still tender and edible. Their vines don’t ramble as much as winter squashes, and are instead more bushy
       in nature. Some common summer squashes are zucchini, patty pan squashes, and straightneck squash. As the name suggests, their 
       storage life is much shorter than that of the winter squash. Pictured below: Winter squash(left), Summer squash(right).</b></p>
